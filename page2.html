      <h1><strong>CSS Positioning</strong></h1>
      <p>
        Hey Kalvian,<br /><br />This is a self-paced lesson that focuses on
        getting started with CSS Positioning.
      </p>
      <h1 id="lg">Learning goals</h1>
      <p>After this lesson,you will know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Positioning in CSS</li>
        <li>Types of positioning</li>
        <li>Z-index</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Have you ever opened the same website using different devices? Mobile,
        laptop,<br />
        tab, etc.? Have you noticed that despite having a lot of elements like
        images, <br />texts, headings, etc., the website looks good on all these
        devices?
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/xT0Gqn9yuw8hnPGn5K/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611af7c20bda4cb96f4f1a207a1fddd23ac57cb74c4&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g"
          alt=""
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        That's because all these elements are placed in a specific position, and
        no matter <br />how narrow or wide your device is, they get aligned
        accordingly.<br /><br />
        Isn't that amazing?ü§îü§î<br /><br />To make a website appear almost the
        same on every device, we need to specify the position property.<br /><br />
        Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and
        make them behave differently, <br />for example, by sitting on top of
        one another or by always remaining in the same place <br />inside the
        browser viewport.<br /><br />CSS positioning is an important technique
        to define how an element will be positioned on a web page.<br /><br />There
        are 4 important types of positioning. They are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Static</li>
        <li>Relative</li>
        <li>Absolute</li>
        <li>Fixed</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="stat">Static Positioning</h1>
      <p>
        This is the default positioning method in CSS . By default, the HTML
        elements are positioned static,<br />
        meaning the top, right, bottom, and left properties remain unaffected.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 id="rela">Relative Positioning</h1>
      <p>
        In this positioning method, the HTML elements will be relatively
        positioned from their normal position.<br />
        The top, right, bottom, and left properties will be relatively
        positioned from their normal position.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 id="abs">Absolute Positioning</h1>
      <p>
        The HTML elements will be positioned according to the nearest positioned
        ancestor in this positioning<br />
        method.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 id="fix">Fixed Positioning</h1>
      <p>
        In this positioning method, the HTML elements will remain the same,
        i.e., when the page is scrolled, <br />the element will be at the same
        position it won't change.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 id="zind">Z-index</h1>
      <p>
        The z-index property controls the vertical stacking order of elements
        that overlap. <br />
        If you have multiple elements overlapping, then the z-index will help
        you decide<br />
        which element should appear physically closer to the user.<br /><br />This
        property takes a number (without decimals) and uses that number to
        <br />calculate which elements appear nearer to the user on the Z axis.
        The higher<br />
        the z-index value, the nearer the element is positioned with respect to
        the user. So, <br />elements will be placed in decreasing order of the
        Z-index.
      </p>

        width="700"
      />
      <p>
        Z-index only affects positioned elements. Z-index doesn‚Äôt work without a
        declared position.
